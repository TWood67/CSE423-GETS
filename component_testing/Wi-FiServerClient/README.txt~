				Sending Packets to Arduino

1. Open up the WiFiUdpSendReceiveString.ino file. Change ssid and pass to the values 
that they should be based on the ssid that you connect to. Verify the local port in 
this file is the same as the one in client.c, if not change them so they are.

2. Upload the sketch to the DUE. Use ctrl + shift + m to open the serial monitor. 
The executebale should output some information to the monitor.

3. Record the Wi-Fi shields ip address. You will need to take this value, and copy it
into client.c.
