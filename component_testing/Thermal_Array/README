                  Note: The sampling rate has been modifed for lower accuracy but higher
                  number of readings

1)	Copy both the Adafruit_TMP006 and Adafruit_Sensor folders from CSE423-GETS/component_testing/Thermal_Array/libraries into your local arduino libraries folder.
2)	Load tmp006.ino into the arduino software.
3)	Connect VCC on the thermal array to +3V on the DUE. 
4)	Connect Gnd on the thermal array to Gnd on the DUE.
5)	Connect SCL on the thermal array to SCL on the DUE. (This is the I2C clock and should be on labeled on the board. I think pin 21)
6)	Connect SDA on the thermal array to SDA on the DUE. (This is the I2C data pin and should be labeled on the board. I think pin 20
7)	Run and compile the sketch with the DUE selected as the board.
8)	Open the serial monitor with 9600 baud rate.
